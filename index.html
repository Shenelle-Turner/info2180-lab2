        <h2>The Harmony Between Steel Pan and Code</h2>
        <p>October 1, 2024 by Shenelle Turner</p>

        <p>Maturity has made me appreciate the nuances of the steel pan, and as such, I find it rather easy to draw 
            comparisons between the artistic facets of playing an instrument and the technical aspect of writing codes. 
            For example, the art of playing the steel pan involves more than just striking the grooves, but applying rhythm 
            in a manner that allows for the production of synchronized beats. Coding also demands the same degree of discipline 
            in the construction of the systems. This is all very relatable to me within music â€“ the attention to detail, the timing and the creativity are what I 
            always find very interesting in programming. Sometimes, in the course of indulging in a web development project, 
            I oftentimes maneuver the code like a piece of a symphony orchestra, in which every line of code is a finely placed 
            note composing a harmony that ties the project together, much like how every note is crucial to the melody of the song.</p>
        <p>There is one downside to this musicality that I feel it benefits coding, and that is web development. Just like I group 
                notes together to create chords, I am using elements to build a complete site using CSS or JavaScript. I strongly believe 
                that the thinking that one must engage in when they are dealing with music helps and enhances creativity, the pulse of how 
                the problem is solved, even to the minutest works such as that of debugging. These do not appear to be tasks, rather they 
                are aspects of improvement of the performance. It is a strange combination, but I must say that programing steel pan taught 
                me a lot about being a developer in the intuitive sense.  </p>

        <h2>A Surprise Reunion with an Old Friend</h2>
        <p>October 1, 2024 by Shenelle Turner</p>

        <p>A few days ago, I came across a former classmate of mine who was the lab technician at my high school. We met unexpectedly as 
            I was on campus grabbing lunch and updating on where life had taken us; it was like no time had gone by. He is the person that 
            encouraged me to explore the world of technology in high school, always ready to help and teaching me how to fix technical issues 
            by myself. I remembered reminiscing about a lot of things, especially about those school days spent in the computer room hardware 
            and networking. We met for lunch and broke bread together, sharing life, reminiscing about old times and how the technological 
            field has drastically changed from when I was still at university.</p>
        <p> I was happy to learn that technology is still his first love and that he has continued to lecture the young ones. I enjoyed the discussion 
            so much because it put into perspective how far I am from those high school years and more so how such experiences helped shape my passion for technology. 
            It was one of those lunch breaks where I always feel inspired and thankful to everyone who has been a part of my journey. <p>
